# PhysicsStupidQuestions
 This is storage/repository(?) for stupid questions in physics that I have faced and personal collections on the potential answers. Most of the pdf files are from online resources found somewhere in the internet. 
 The rights are to those who made it, I don't hold any rights to these documents.
